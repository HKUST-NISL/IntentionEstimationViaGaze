(1) The markov chain definition is provided. Note that the user has to specify the parameters.
(2) The optimal branch vertex definition is provided. The user could use these definitions together with his / her own symbolic task definitions and planner to create an optimal branch. Note that the user will have to implement the discretization of raw observations into action / gaze observations that our Markov chain accepts.
(3) One possible tool for setting up the task definitions and perform planning in HTN to use with the optimal branch is HATP from LAAS, https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/HATP
